### My Opinions & thoughts

I am not a die-hard fan of any particular tech and am always open to working with new technologies. At the end all tech is tool for getting stuff done. When it is the right tool I don't mind learning it.

When working in a team I try to leave things a bit better than what I got when dealing with anyone else's work. Of course have to make a trade-off between product deadlines and what is best.

I believe in over-communicating over catching people by surprise.
